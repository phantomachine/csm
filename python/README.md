**C**ompetitive **S**earch with endogenous **I**ncomplete **M**arkets

Python codes and (Data) Jupyter Notebook for paper *Inflationary Redistribution vs. Trading Opportunities* by Timothy Kam and Junsang Lee

Stationary monetary equilibrium in a competitive search environment with limited and endogenous asset-market participation 

Code solves and simulates stationary equilibrium behavior and non-degenerate distribution of agents

A current version of the paper can be found here

* CSSEGMOD: Class file

* MAIN: Script for running an instance of the model

* SETOPS: Some Python tools for set operations (custom coded)

* SETOUTPATHS: Determine where to save results (.NPZ files) and figures (.PNG and .EPS files)
 * Users need to customize to own computer setting
 
Python 2.7/3.6 code for solving and simulating monetary equilibria in the model of Kam and Lee (2020). Code uses MPI4Py and OpenMPI for parallel computation.

## Code Example

To run the MAIN.PY file in normal mode (serial):

> ``python main.py``

or, in IPython:

> ``run main``

To run the MAIN.PY file using OpenMPI:

> ``mpirun -n YourNumberOfCPUs python main.py``

or, if you have chmod MAIN.PY to be BASH Executable you can also invoke as

> ``mpirun -n YourNumberOfCPUs ./main.py``

Same goes for CALIBRATE.PY or COMPARESTEADYSTATES.PY
